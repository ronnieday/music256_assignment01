Triad Building Synthesizer
Version 0.1
Wednesday, October 5, 2016

DESCRIPTION:

Equal temperament frequencies from C3-C4 are selected via radio buttons.  When a chord type is also selected, additive synthesis is used to build a triad out of simple sine waves.  Currently, major and minor chords are supported.

PLANNED UPDATES:

- I would like to add support for keyboard control for both note selection, and chord type.  This would make the synthesizer much more playable.

- I would also like to add support for different waveforms (sine, sawtooth, triangle, square).
